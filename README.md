Remote sensing scene classification model of only 171KB size with 99.86% accuracyï¼Œbase on RSI-CB128

### Remote Sensing Scene Classification with MobileNetV2
## Introduction
This is a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) model based on the **MobileNetV2** architecture, designed for efficient classification of 20 remote sensing scene classes in the **RSI-CB128** dataset. The project focuses on minimizing model size to the extreme while maintaining high accuracy, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Training

You can use the following command to train the model (example):
```bash
python train.py --model_type custom_cnn --data_dir RSI-CB128 --batch_size 32 --epochs 10 --lr 0.001
````

### Evaluation

Use the following command to evaluate a trained model:

```bash
python eval.py --model_type custom_cnn --weights_path ./custom_cnn_final.pth
